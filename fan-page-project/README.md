## Midterm Project (Fan Page Project + Chats)
This was a challenging project but I learned a lot from it. I used React Native and Firebase and some notable libraries I used were React Navigation, GiftedChat, Expo Secure Store. The hardest parts of the project were:
1. Figuring out React Navigation / navigating between different screens
2. Firebase calls for realtime data (ensuring react state is up to date)
3. Figuring out how to store data to get latest chat / and list of users that the current user is chatting with

To run the project, after installing all the necessary dependencies, `npm start` then it will prompt you to enter `i` for iOS, `a` for android, and `w` for web. You will need to setup the necessary simulators for iOS and Android.
